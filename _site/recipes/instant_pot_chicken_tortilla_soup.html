<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
  <li>1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped (about 2 cups)</li>
  <li>3 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>Kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon ancho chili powder</li>
  <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
  <li>1 canned chipotle in adobo, finely minced (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)</li>
  <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds)</li>
  <li>One 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
  <li>One 28-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
  <li>1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed</li>
  <li>Suggested toppings, such as lightly crushed tortilla chips, diced avocado, crumbled queso fresco or cotija cheese, cilantro leaves, sour cream and/or lime wedges</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Set a 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot® to high saute (see Cook’s Note) and allow it to heat up for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the canola oil to the pot, then add the onion, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt; cook until the onion is tender, stirring frequently, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn off the Instant Pot and stir in the ancho chili powder and a splash of the chicken broth and cook in the residual heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon or heatproof silicone spatula.</li>
  <li>Add the chipotle in adobo, chicken thighs, black beans, tomatoes, remaining chicken broth and 1 teaspoon salt to the pot. Follow the manufacturer’s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure-cook on high for 10 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer’s guide for natural release. After 5 minutes, being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid.</li>
  <li>Remove the chicken thighs from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Stir the corn into the hot soup. Shred the chicken meat with 2 forks, then put it back in the soup. Season with more salt if needed.</li>
  <li>Ladle into soup bowls and serve with desired toppings.</li>
</ol>
