## Ingredients
- 1 Tbs black pepper
- 1 lb filet mignon (or other steak cut, cut into 1/2-inch cubes)
- 4 Tbs oyster sauce
- 2 Tbs Shaoxing wine (can substitute mirin)
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp potato starch (can substitute corn starch)
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 2 Tbs vegetable oil
- 1 large onion
- 2 bell peppers
- 3 cloves of garlic

## Instructions
1. Put the black peppercorns in a mortar and use a pestle to crack the peppercorns coarsely. If you donâ€™t have a mortar and pestle, put the peppercorns in a freezer bag and use a rolling pin to crush them.
2. In a bowl, combine the cubed beef along with most of the black pepper (saving a little to garnish), oyster sauce, Shaoxing, soy sauce, potato starch, and sesame oil. Mix well to combine and allow the beef to marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 12 hours in the fridge.
3. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the vegetable oil, and then use tongs to add the beef in a single layer. Try to leave as much of the marinade in the bowl as possible.
4. Fry the beef on one side until golden brown, and then flip each piece and fry the second side, until browned.
5. Dump the onions, bell pepper, and garlic into the pan and turn the heat to up to high. Stir-fry, tossing the contents of the pan periodically to ensure everything cooks evenly.
6.  When the onions start becoming translucent, add the remaining marinade and toss everything together until the black pepper beef is shiny and evenly coated with sauce.
7.  Serve with rice and garnish with the remaining black pepper (to taste).
