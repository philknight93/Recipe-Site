tags: tp entree
source: https://norecipes.com/black-pepper-beef/
yield: 2 servings
ingredients: 
- 6 grams whole black peppercorns (~2 tsps)
- 300 grams filet mignon (or other steak cut, cut into 1/2-inch cubes)
- 2 Tbs oyster sauce
- 1 Tbs Shaoxing wine (can substitute mirin)
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp potato starch
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 Tbs vegetable oil
- 140 grams onion (~1 small onion, cut into 1/2-inch squares)
- 85 grams bell pepper (~1 small pepper, cut into 1/2-inch squares)
- 12 grams garlic (~2 large cloves, chopped)
instructions: 
- Put the black peppercorns in a mortar and use a pestle to crack the peppercorns coarsely. If you donâ€™t have a mortar and pestle, put the peppercorns in a freezer bag and use a rolling pin to crush them.
- Grind the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle.
- In a bowl, combine the cubed beef along with most of the black pepper (saving a little to garnish), oyster sauce, Shaoxing, soy sauce, potato starch, and sesame oil. Mix well to combine and allow the beef to marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 12 hours in the fridge.
- Marinate the cubes of steak in oyster sauce and black pepper.
- Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the vegetable oil, and then use tongs to add the beef in a single layer. Try to leave as much of the marinade in the bowl as possible.
- Sear the cubes of beef.
- Fry the beef on one side until golden brown, and then flip each piece and fry the second side, until browned.
- Once the black pepper beef has browned on one side, flip it over.
- Dump the onions, bell pepper, and garlic into the pan and turn the heat to up to high. Stir-fry, tossing the contents of the pan periodically to ensure everything cooks evenly.
- Add the onions and bell peppers to the black pepper beef.
- When the onions start becoming translucent, add the remaining marinade and toss everything together until the black pepper beef is shiny and evenly coated with sauce.
- Serve with rice and garnish with the remaining black pepper (to taste).
