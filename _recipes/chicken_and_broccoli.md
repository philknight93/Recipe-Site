## Ingredients
- 1 pound chicken thighs
- 2 broccoli florets
- 1.5 Tbs sugar
- 2 Tbs cornstarch
- 4 Tbs mirin
- 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 2/3 cup chicken broth (we use 1/3 cup)
- 4 tsp sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp white pepper
- 1 1/2 Tbs minced garlic
- 1 Tbs minced ginger
- Cooking oil of choice
- (optional) 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- (optional) sesame seeds as garnish

## Instructions
1. Cut the chicken into cubes. Cut the head of broccoli florets to small, edible pieces.
2. Turn on the heat to medium high. In a large pot, cook the chicken for about 6-8 minutes or until all pieces are fully cooked through.
3. Remove the cooked chicken to a plate. Clean the pot.
4. In a mixing bowl, add the soy sauce, chicken broth, cornstarch, mirin, sugar, sesame oil, and white pepper. Whisk until everything is completely dissolved.
5. Add the remaining oil to the pot. If using red pepper flakes, add them in now and let sit in the pot for about 30 seconds. Do not burn the flakes.
6. Add garlic and ginger to the pot, and cook for about 30 seconds until very fragrant but not browned.
7. Add in the well-combined sauce, broccoli, and chicken to the pot (in this order). Constantly stir and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
8. Garnish with sesame seeds if desired. Serve with rice.
