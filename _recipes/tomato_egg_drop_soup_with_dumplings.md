yield: 4 servings
ingredients: 
- 2 large tomatoes
- 1/2 Tbs vegetable oil
- 1 small garlic clove, finely minced
- 4-5 cups chicken stock
- 2 Tbs soy sauce
- 1 Tbs cornstarch, mixed with 1 Tbs water
- 1/2 cup flour
- 2 eggs, lightly whisked
- Salt and ground pepper to taste
- 1 Tsp sesame oil
- (optional) 1 spring onions (scallions), sliced
instructions: 
- Cut tomatoes into wedges. Season with salt, and allow them to sit for a couple of minutes before using.
- Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over high heat. Add the tomatoes, then add the minced garlic. 
- Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until the tomatoes start to soften. 
- Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. 
- Add soy sauce and cornstarch to the pot. Stir until the soup is lightly thickened. 
- In another bowl, add the flour, and then steadily add a very weak stream of water to the flour bowl while stirring constantly, until the flour has mostly clumped up into small chunks. Add the clumped up flour to the pot and stir (making sure the flour don't all clump up together). Simmer for 1-2 minutes. 
- Before adding the egg, stir the soup to form a vortex in the centre. Pour the whisked egg into the centre of the vortex and stir vigorously to form the lacy egg.
- Season with salt and pepper. Add sliced spring onions on top if desired. Remove from heat. 
- Drizzle with sesame oil before serving.
