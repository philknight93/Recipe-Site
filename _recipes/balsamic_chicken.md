## Ingredients
- 8 oz Brussels Sporuts
- 12 oz Yukon Gold potatoes
- 1 tsp fresh minced rosemary leaves
- 10 oz chicken
- chicken stock concentrate (equiv to 2 cups of stock)
- 1 clove gralic
- 5 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 Tbs italian seasoning
- 4 tsp cooking oil
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 Tbs butter
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- salt
- pepper

## Instructions
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 deg F. Wash and dry produce. Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Trim and halve Brussels sprouts lengthwise. Pick rosemary leaves from stems; mince leaves until you have 1 tsp
2. Toss potatoes on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the garlic, half the Italian Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you’ll add more to the sheet then).
3. Once potatoes have roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Carefully toss Brussels sprouts on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Return to top rack until browned and tender, 18-22 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with remaining Italian Seasoning, salt, and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a cutting board to rest.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for chicken over medium heat. Add minced rosemary and remaining garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Stir in vinegar; simmer until syrupy, 30 seconds. Stir in stock concentrates, ¼ cup water, and ½ tsp sugar. (For 4 servings, use ⅓ cup water and 1 tsp sugar.) Simmer until thickened, 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 TBSP butter until melted. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Thinly slice chicken crosswise. Divide chicken, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes between plates. Drizzle chicken with sauce and serve.
