## Ingredients
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 Tbs dried parsley (or dried cilantro)
- 1/2 large red onion, cubed
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 (16 oz) can of reduced-sodium great northern beans, drained
- 1 (10 oz) can of rotel tomatoes, preferably mild (do NOT drain)
- 1 Tsp chopped green chilis (from 4.5 oz can)
- 8 oz whole kernel corn (canned or frozen)
- 1 Tbs chili powder
- 1/2 Tbs chipotle chili powder (or less depending on taste)
- 1/2 Tbs ancho chili powder (or less depending on taste)
- 1/2 Tbs ground cumin
- Salt & pepper to taste
- 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken stock
- 1/4 block of cream cheese (~2 oz.)
- (optional) 1/4 cup chopped cilantro

## Instructions
1. In a pot, add enough water to submerge the chicken breasts (approximately 3 cups in a sauce pot). Also add approximately 1/4 cup of onion, half of minced garlic, dried parsley (or dried cilantro), and salt & pepper to the pot. Half cover and bring the whole thing to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, and boil for 15 to 20 minutes, or until chicken is fully cooked through
2. Remove boiled chicken breast to a cutting board. Set aside both the chicken breasts and the boiling water
3. In another large pot, on medium heat, saut√© the remaining cubed onion and garlic, until the onion becomes translucent
4. Add rotel tomatoes, great northern beans, whole kernel corn, green chilis, and spices to the pot. Stir to combine
5. Scoop 2 cups worth of chicken boiling water to the pot. Drain the remaining chicken boiling water, and add the drained content (onion & garlic & parsley) to the large pot. Also add another 2 cups of chicken stock
6. Bring the whole thing to a rapid boil and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes
7. While the chili is simmering, use two forks to shred the chicken breast. Add in the shredded chicken after the 10 minute mark, and simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes
8. Add small blocks of cream cheese to the pot. Stir to dissolve. Stop when the soup is thickened, and the color becomes lighter, resembling chili consistency
9. (optional) top with chopped cilantro. Serve with a side of garlic bread if desired
