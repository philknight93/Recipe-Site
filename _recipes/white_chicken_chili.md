yield: 10 servings
ingredients: 
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 Tbs dried parsley (or dried cilantro)
- 1/2 large red onion, cubed
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 (16 oz) cans of reduced-sodium great northern beans, drained
- 1 (10 oz) can of rotel tomatoes, preferably mild (do NOT drain)
- 1 Tsp chopped green chilis (from 4.5 oz can)
- 8 oz whole kernel corn (canned or frozen)
- 1 Tbs chili powder
- 1/2 Tbs chipotle chili powder (or less depending on taste)
- 1/2 Tbs ancho chili powder (or less depending on taste)
- 1/2 Tbs ground cumin
- Salt & pepper to taste
- 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken stock
- 1/4 block of cream cheese (~2 oz.)
- (optional) 1/4 cup chopped cilantro

instructions: 
- In a pot, add enough water to submerge the chicken breasts (approximately 3 cups in a sauce pot). Also add approximately 1/4 cup of onion, half of minced garlic, dried parsley (or dried cilantro), and salt & pepper to the pot. Half cover and bring the whole thing to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, and boil for 15 to 20 minutes, or until chicken is fully cooked through
- Remove boiled chicken breast to a cutting board. Set aside both the chicken breasts and the boiling water
- In another large pot, on medium heat, saut√© the remaining cubed onion and garlic, until the onion becomes translucent
- Add rotel tomatoes, great northern beans, whole kernel corn, green chilis, and spices to the pot. Stir to combine
- Scoop 2 cups worth of chicken boiling water to the pot. Drain the remaining chicken boiling water, and add the drained content (onion & garlic & parsley) to the large pot. Also add another 2 cups of chicken stock
- Bring the whole thing to a rapid boil and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes
- While the chili is simmering, use two forks to shred the chicken breast. Add in the shredded chicken after the 10 minute mark, and simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes
- Add small blocks of cream cheese to the pot. Stir to dissolve. Stop when the soup is thickened, and the color becomes lighter, resembling chili consistency
- (optional) top with chopped cilantro. Serve with a side of garlic bread if desired
