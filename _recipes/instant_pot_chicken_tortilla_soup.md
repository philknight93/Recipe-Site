## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped (about 2 cups)
- 3 large cloves garlic, minced
- Kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons ancho chili powder (originally called for 1 Tbs)
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 canned chipotle in adobo, finely minced (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds)
- One 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
- One 28-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
- Suggested toppings, such as lightly crushed tortilla chips, diced avocado, crumbled queso fresco or cotija cheese, cilantro leaves, sour cream and/or lime wedges


## Instructions
1. Set a 6- or 8-quart Instant PotÂ® to high saute (see Cook's Note) and allow it to heat up for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the canola oil to the pot, then add the onion, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt; cook until the onion is tender, stirring frequently, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn off the Instant Pot and stir in the ancho chili powder and a splash of the chicken broth and cook in the residual heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon or heatproof silicone spatula.
2. Add the chipotle in adobo, chicken thighs, black beans, tomatoes, remaining chicken broth and 1 teaspoon salt to the pot. Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure-cook on high for 10 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's guide for natural release. After 5 minutes, being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. 
3. Remove the chicken thighs from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Stir the corn into the hot soup. Shred the chicken meat with 2 forks, then put it back in the soup. Season with more salt if needed.  
4. Ladle into soup bowls and serve with desired toppings.
