## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds frozen or fresh chicken breasts (this was 2 chicken breast halves for me)
- 1 or 2 (14.5 oz) cans petite diced tomatoes (if you want it more saucy then use 2 cans)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 1/2 cup chicken broth (or 1/2 cup water and 1/2 tsp better than bouillon chicken base*)
- 1 (19 oz) bag frozen cheese tortellini
- 1/2 cup half and half
- 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 3 Tbsp chopped fresh basil or basil stir-in paste
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: halved cherry tomatoes for topping

## Instructions
1. Add chicken, tomatoes, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and chicken broth to the Instant Pot.
2. Cover and secure the lid, make sure valve is set to sealing. Set manual/pressure cook button to 10 minutes (fresh chicken) or 12 minutes (frozen chicken).
3. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then move the valve to venting to remove any remaining pressure.
4. Use a fork to place the chicken on a cutting board. Set aside.
5. Add the tortellini to the pot. Put the lid on the pot and move valve to sealing. Set the manual/pressure cook button to 0 (zero) minutes. While the pot cooks the tortellini, cut the chicken into bite size pieces.
6. When the timer beeps perform a quick release by moving the valve to venting.  Remove the lid.
7. Add the cut up chicken into the pot. Stir in the half and half, parmesan cheese and basil. Salt and pepper to taste. Add in cherry tomatoes, if desired.
8. Serve and enjoy
