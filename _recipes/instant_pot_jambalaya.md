## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 12–16 ounces chicken andouille sausage, sliced into ½ inch thick rounds
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 ribs celery, sliced
- 1 red (or green) bell pepper, large dice
- 1 jalapeno, finely chopped ( or sub one small can green chilies)
- 4–6 cloves garlic, rough chopped
- 1  14 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 4 cups chicken broth ( or shellfish broth)
- 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme  (or 1 teaspoon dry thyme )
- 1 teaspoon dry oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoons kosher salt (we usually cut this to 1/4 - 1/2 tsp)
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons regular paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or chili flakes (we usually cut this down to 1/4 tsp)
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce ( if using chicken broth )
- Optional: 8–16 ounces large raw shrimp ( peeled and de-veined, if frozen see notes)
- Optional additions: 1 cup fresh or frozen peas and 1 cup asparagus, 2 cups roasted veggies, or 1 can cooked chickpeas.

## Instructions
1. In a Instant Pot, using the saute function, heat oil and add sausage and sauté for about 5 minutes or until browned. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic and jalapeño, and cook, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes or until fragrant.
2. Add tomatoes and their juices, broth , thyme, oregano, bay leaves, paprika, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, cayenne and fish sauce.
3. Bring to a simmer and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot ( this will help prevent the “burn error” from turning on while pressure cooking). I find using a wooden spoon works best here.  Add the rice, give a good stir (see note about shrimp!)and set Instant Pot to HIGH pressure for 5 minutes.
4. Let naturally release for 5 minutes, then manually release, covering steam spout with a kitchen towel.
5. Stir in thawed shrimp and let this cook on “warm” setting for 5-7 minutes ( depending on size), adding peas and asparagus at the same time. When shrimp is done ( it will look pink) taste for salt and spice level, adding more to taste.
6. Garnish with sliced green onion and chopped parsley.

### Notes
- Use fish sauce in the recipe to replace the traditional shellfish broth. It works!
- If using large frozen raw shrimp, feel free to add to Instant pot and let it pressure cook with the rice. If using thawed or cooked shrimp, add to the pot after pressure cooking. If adding after – maybe give the shrimp a quick sear in an oiled pan on the stove, adding pinch of salt and smoked paprika.
