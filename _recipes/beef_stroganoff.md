## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground beef, cooked, drained and rinsed (rinsing optional)
- 1 (10.5 oz.) can cream of mushroom soup
- 3/4 cup sour cream
- 1/2 lb egg noodles, cooked and drained
- 1/2 tbsp worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp paprika
- salt and pepper to taste 

## Instructions
1. Cook your egg noodles according to the package.  Drain and set aside.
2. In a large skillet, on medium heat, brown your ground beef, then drain and rinse (rinsing optional).  
3. Add the cooked ground beef back in to the same skillet and add your cream of musroom soup and sour cream.  Stir together. Heat on medium-low heat.  
4. Add your Worcestershire sauce,  paprika, seasonings and salt and pepper to taste. (I usually use at least 1 tsp of salt then add more as needed).
5. Add in the cooked noodles, stirring to make sure it is fully mixed.  Continue to heat for a few minutes, then taste again and season to taste as needed.
6. This Stroganoff can be kept in the fridge for 4-5 days and reheated as needed.
