## Ingredients
- 1 leg butternut squash, cut into ¼”/.5cm triangles
- Olive oil 
- 50g (6T) pine nuts 
- 225g (.5lb) campanelli pasta 
- 5-6 leaves sage, thinly sliced
- 100g (7T) unsalted butter 
- 50g (1/2c) grated parmesan (plus extra for topping) 
- Lemon 
- Chili flake 

## Instructions
1. Remove stem & bottom bulge of squash. Peel and cut the rest of the squash into ¼”/.5cm triangles. 
1. Spread squash onto parchment lined half sheet tray. Toss with olive oil, salt, & pepper. Roast for 10min at 450F/232C. You should have enough squash to nearly fill a half sheet tray.
1. Toast pine nuts on a small sheet tray in the oven (450F/232C), 5-6 mins. 
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt & pasta. Cook to al dente. Reserve 250ml/1c pasta water. Drain & set aside pasta while you build the sauce. 
1. Return empty pasta pot to medium heat. Add 50g butter & sliced sage. Fry sage for 90 sec until butter has browned. Add reserved pasta water and drained pasta. Reduce heat to low and add another 50g pasta. Stir and toss the pasta while shaking the pan to emulsify the sauce. After about a minute the texture should be silky. 
1. Off heat, add half the toasted nuts, all of the roasted squash, and 50g parm. Stir to gently melt the cheese. Plate up and top with a squeeze of lemon juice, a pinch of parm, chili flakes, pine nuts, and a drizzle of olive oil.
