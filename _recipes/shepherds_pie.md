## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground beef (for authentic Shepherd's pie, use ground lamb instead)
- 3 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1/2 stick (4 Tbs) butter
- 1-2 Tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 cup beef broth
- 1-2 cups vegetables (ex. diced carrots, diced green bell pepper, corn, peas)
- Salt, pepper, other seasonings of choice
- Some neutral cooking oil of choice

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in a medium sized pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).
3. While the potatoes are cooking, add some cooking oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.
4. Add vegetables to the sauté pan according to their cooking time (ex. peas or corn should be added at the end of the cooking of the onions).
5. Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt, pepper, and other desired seasonings.
6. Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.
7. When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables in an even layer in a large baking dish (9x13 casserole). Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef.
9. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes.
10. Place in a 400F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown. (Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.)
